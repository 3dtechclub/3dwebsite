        <p style="text-align:justify"> Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> The tech tycoon Elon Musk quotes," AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization." Whether Artificial Intelligence is a threat or not is debatable. The term Artificial Intelligence was first coined decades ago in the year 1956 by John McCarty at the Dartmouth conference. He defined Artificial Intelligence as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. In a sense, AI is a technique of getting machines to work and behave like humans. It has been used so far by creating machines and robots that are being used in a wide range of fields including healthcare, robotics, marketing, business analytics, fashion industry, and many more. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> The textile and fashion industry is one of the oldest and most globalized sectors in the world, and nowadays it plays a key role in the development of the economy and trade. In the past, we used to go to the shops and buy clothes, but now we have advanced technology to bring it to our doorstep. Artificial intelligence is changing fashion, and shopping is becoming more individual and intuitive. Customers now becoming aware to use the AI-enabled features while searching or buying clothing or fashion accessories online. Customers can take a photo and match the accessories and clothes over brands to get the same design.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> Even though AI has been around for several years now, the technologies that are currently being applied to fashion are still in their early days. While there is still a long way to go until in-store artificial intelligence is fully realized, the following companies are just a few examples of those that are leading the way.</p>

        <p><strong>Alibaba</strong> has opened a fashion AI concept store, right next to Hong Kong polytechnic university's fashion faculty, where academics, engineers, and fashionistas are working together to envision the future of fashion retail in 2018. We can check into the concept store with a Mobile Taobao ID code, and shoppers can opt into a face scan for a more personalized experience. Customers can browse around like they would at any clothing store. The difference is that items they pick up from RFID-enabled clothing racks will automatically show up in the mirror. The smart mirror also shows personalized mix-and-match options to complete the look. It also directs shoppers to where other suggested items can be found inside the store. For people who want to try before they buy, there's no need to carry around the pile of clothes while they shop. They can just add them to their virtual shopping cart and head to the fitting room hands-free. Before entering the fitting room, where there isn’t any camera installed, the staff scan customers' Taobao ID code to connect their account to the mirror. They can use the mirror to look through the selected items and update size and color changes. The mirror will alert staff to bring in the garment or shoes in the new size or color. Shoppers can also browse through a virtual wardrobe on mobile Taobao to see the clothes they've tried in-store and explore more mix-and-match options from other brands and Alibaba's e-commerce sites, Taobao and Tmall.</p>

        <p> <strong>Amazon</strong> has developed an algorithm that is capable of designing clothes through the analysis of many images. It copies the styles and applies them to a new item from scratch. And also it already leverages AI to power Style by Alexa, a feature of the Amazon Shopping app that suggests, compares, and rates apparel using algorithms and human curation. With style recommendations and programs like Prime Wardrobe, which allows users to try on clothes and return what they don’t want to buy, the retailer is vying for a larger slice of sales in a declining apparel market while surfacing products that customers might not normally choose. It’s a win for businesses on its face-excepting cases where the recommended accessories are Amazon's own, of course. </p>

        <p> <strong>H&M Group</strong> has been heavily investing in artificial intelligence to stay on top of fashion cycles, and also to support its massive growth. With the help of algorithms, they analyze store receipts and returns to evaluate purchases in each store. This way, the fashion brand knows which items to promote and stock more of in certain locations. And also fashion retailers like H&M rely on fresh products at competitive prices. Data insights help H&M to predict what the market wants so they don’t have to discount their inventory to sell it out. They have automated warehouses that will ultimately offer next-day deliveries for the majority of the European markets. The warehouses and their free shipping, exclusive for loyal customers, are driven by algorithms and data.

          <ul>
            <p>Many successful fashion websites can keep a log of the browsing patterns of their customers, and in turn suggest similar items based on color, style, and design.</p>
            <p>The emergence of chatbot technology has significantly increased conversion and communication between the customer and fashion brands. So they can give solutions to help track leads, answer questions, and even give product recommendations.</p>
            <p>It can automate mundane tasks. They can assess margins with greater accuracy and organization using AI, requiring less manpower. This frees up many retailers to focus on more important matters like strategy and execution.</p>
            <p>There's more to the fashion AI concept store than its futuristic appeal. Real-time analytics enables staff to move much faster and provide customers with an efficient, stress-free experience. It also helps brands maintain their inventory.</p>

    <div class="col-md-12 col-12"> <h4 style="text-align:justify">  There are pros and cons to most of the things in the world. Some people think that this technological concept is dripping out creativity because there's always that argument, that designers create something from their brain that's like newness, and that's not been done in AI concept because it looks at everything that has been done before and creates something new. And also, the AI may end up being more creative than humans as it can process so many more images that we are capable of seeing. The courses also preparing students for job losses in their industry to Artificial Intelligence especially in areas like pattern cutting and other repetitive work.</p>
    <p>Based on a report by Tractica, the global AI software market is expected to grow massively in the next few years, with revenues increasing from around 9.5 billion to 118.6 billion USD by 2025. Also, according to a study by Juniper Research, global retail spending on AI will grow to $7.3 billion per year by 2022. This is up by 5 billion, from an estimated $2 billion in 2018.</p>
